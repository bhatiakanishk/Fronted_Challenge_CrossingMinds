## Challenges and Successes Faced

1) Understanding the requirements
```
I had to thoroughly read through the instructions and requirements provided. I broke the challenge into 2 parts: a) Frontend Design and b) Backend API integration
```

2) Designing UI with responsiveness in mind
```
Making sure that the website looks appealing on both a large and small screen was essential. It was not just about resizing the the components, but also organizing the components for all users
```

3) Overcoming a data format issue
```
For the product page, the mock data provided was in a simple format, and I was able to integrate it with the frontend fairly quick. But for the carousel, it took some time to understand the mock data. I went through the item data a couple of times to understand it and ways to extract data from it.
```

4) Making use of reusable component
```
I was able to reuse the Carousel component for both the "More of this style" and  "You might also like", by passing different titles in the DOM.
